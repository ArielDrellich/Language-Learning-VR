Hey

Thanks for downloading my Low Poly Table Tennis pack, I hope it suits your needs.

To use these assets simply drag them from the prefab folder into your scene and resize them to suit your needs.

If you wish to customize these assets with other colours/materials you can do so by creating a new material a dragging it into the scene and onto the prefab you are tying to change. 
Alternatively you can edit the matierals I have already made, which can be found the materials folder.
